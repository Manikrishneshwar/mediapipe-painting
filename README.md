This project is an interactive drawing application that uses MediaPipe's hand tracking to turn your hand gestures into a virtual paintbrush and eraser on your computer screen.

## Features

- Eraser mode to remove brush strokes near the index finger.
- Toggle pencil/eraser modes by pointing your ring finger up.
- Visual mode indicator shown on the screen.


## Usage

- Use your **index finger** to draw on the screen.
- Bring index and middle finger tips together to lift the pen and stop drawing.
- Point your **ring finger up** to toggle between pencil and eraser modes.
- Eraser deletes the brush strokes near your index finger tip.
